*Lab Report 5 - Putting it All Together*

## Part 1 – Debugging Scenario

Design a debugging scenario, and write your report as a conversation on EdStem. It should have:

1. The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is.
2. A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try.
3. Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.
4. At the end, all the information needed about the setup including:
- The file & directory structure needed
- The contents of each file before fixing the bug
- The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
- A description of what to edit to fix the bug

You should actually set up and run the scenario from your screenshots. It should involve at least a Java file and a bash script. Describing the bug should involve reading some output at the terminal resulting from running one or more commands. Design an error that produces more interesting output than a single message about a syntax or unbound identifier error – showcase some interesting wrong behavior! Feel free to set this up by cloning and breaking some existing code like the grading script or code from class, or by designing something of your own from scratch, etc.

## Part 2 – Reflection

*In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from your lab experience in the second half of this quarter that you didn’t know before. It could be a technical topic we addressed specifically, something cool you found out on your own building on labs, something you learned from a tutor or classmate, and so on.*

My lab experience in the second half of this quarter has been insightful and fun; I've learned quite a lot!

The most interesting one was getting to understand how grading scripts and autograders are built and how they work, and even getting to try to build one on my own. Every time I submit a programming assignment in other CSE classes, I've always wondered how the autograders on Gradescope worked. Getting my grading script/autograder to run properly was definitely a struggle at first, but after some help from my lab friends and tutors, we finally got it working at the end.

Another thing I learned that I believe is going to be the most useful and practical is how to do everything from the command line: committing and pushing to GitHub, editing files on Vim and all the cool tricks and shortcuts that come with it. I actually enjoyed Lab 7 where I timed myself doing command line tasks and constantly tried to beat my own record by learning and getting used to the different shortcuts.
