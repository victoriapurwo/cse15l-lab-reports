*Lab Report 4 - Vim*

*Tuesday, 28 November 2023*

---

For the lab report this week, reproduce the task below. For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. For special characters like ```<enter>``` or ```<tab>```, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.

1. Setup: Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. Setup: Fork the repository
3. The real deal: Start the timer!
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the ```SSH``` URL)
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)

## Step 4
### Log into ieng6

Keys pressed:
```ssh cs15lfa23mg@ieng6.ucsd.edu```
```<enter>```

I am already set up to SSH without a password using keys, so typing the keys above immediately logged me into my account and remotely connected me to ieng-202, as shown in the image above.
